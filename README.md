## Overview

This repository contains a Go implementation of the BitTorrent algorithm, which enables efficient peer-to-peer file sharing. The algorithm allows multiple peers to share pieces of a file simultaneously, maximizing download speeds and reducing server load.

## Theoretical Background

### BitTorrent Protocol

BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer file-sharing protocol that breaks files into smaller pieces. Key features include:

- **Piece Distribution:** Files are divided into small chunks, allowing users to download from multiple peers simultaneously.
- **Seeders and Leechers:** Seeders have the complete file and share it, while leechers are in the process of downloading.
- **Tit for Tat:** A strategy to promote sharing; peers download from those they are uploading to.
- **Choking and Unchoking:** Controls the connection between peers based on their sharing rates.

### Components

- **Tracker:** A server that helps peers find each other.
- **Peer:** A client that downloads and uploads pieces of files.
- **Swarm:** The group of peers sharing a particular file.
